Using Github Copilot in VSCode with Claude Sonnet 4 in agent mode.

Prompt 1:

```
In this main.py file, I want to write a function which takes the path to a csv file.

It should take the textPayload header column from the csv file.

A row entry for textPayload should look like

I want to extract the timestamp and the number of ms, and store them in a dataframe
```

Response 1:

```
I'll help you create a function that reads a CSV file and extracts the timestamp and milliseconds from the textPayload column. Let me first examine the current main.py file and then implement the solution.

Read main.py

Now let me look at one of the CSV files to understand the structure:

Read 1.0.6-logs.csv, lines 1 to 5

Perfect! I can see the CSV structure. The textPayload column contains log entries with timestamps and milliseconds. Now I'll create a function that extracts this information. Let me write the implementation:

Created main.py

Now let me test the function to make sure it works correctly:

python main.py
```

Prompt 2:

```
This is great, add code to create graphs of both files timings, with the timestamp on the x axis and the ms on the y axis.
```

Response 2:

```
I'll add code to create graphs comparing the timings from both CSV files. Let me add the necessary imports and graph generation functions to your main.py file.

main.py+3-0
I see matplotlib isn't installed. Let me add the graph generation functions and then we can install the required packages. First, let me add the graph functions:

main.py+141-0
Now let me update the main execution block to include the graph generation:

main.py+33-9
```

Prompt 3:

```
Write new code, that finds all the entries with matching queries

That's the textPayload starting after "> neo4 - "

that occur within 500ms of the same time

And where the 1.1.0 query time is greater than the 1.0.6, and plot them
```

Response 3:

```
I'll add a function to find matching queries between the two datasets and compare their performance. Let me add this new functionality:

main.py+175-0
Now let me update the main execution block to include the new query matching analysis:

main.py+32-0
Perfect! I've added comprehensive functionality to find and analyze matching queries between the two datasets. Here's what the new code does:

New Functions Added:
extract_query_text() - Extracts the actual query text from the textPayload (everything after "> neo4j - ")

find_matching_queries() - Finds queries that:

Appear in both datasets with identical query text
Occur within 500ms of each other (configurable)
Have worse performance in 1.1.0 compared to 1.0.6
plot_matching_queries() - Creates four visualizations:

Scatter plot comparing 1.0.6 vs 1.1.0 performance
Distribution of performance regressions
Distribution of performance ratios
Time series showing when regressions occurred
analyze_query_regressions() - Provides statistical analysis including:

Average/median regression amounts
Performance ratios
Queries with 2x+ and 5x+ slowdowns
Identification of the worst performing query
Enhanced Main Execution:
The main block now:

Finds matching queries with performance regressions
Shows detailed regression analysis statistics
Displays the top 5 worst performing queries
Generates regression-specific visualizations
Maintains all existing functionality
The analysis will help you identify which specific queries got slower between versions 1.0.6 and 1.1.0, by how much, and when these regressions occurred. The visualizations will make it easy to spot patterns and outliers in the performance data.

We can see a couple problems.
the total matched queries in the regression analysis is 11019, which is more than our total number of queries (10000)
The aver performance ratio was inf, which is bad

And we got an error generating the chart
```

Response 4:

```
You're absolutely right! There are several issues with the current implementation:

Duplicate matches: The nested loop is creating multiple matches for the same queries
Infinite ratios: When ms1 is 0, we get inf ratios which break the histogram
Too many matches: We're getting more matches than total queries
Let me fix these issues:

main.py+29-9
Now let me fix the plotting function to handle edge cases and filter out any potential infinite values:

main.py+26-8
Now let me also fix the regression analysis function to handle the infinite values properly:

main.py+12-3
Perfect! I've fixed the key issues:

Problems Fixed:
Duplicate Matches: Now using a "best match" approach - for each query in dataset 1, we find the single closest matching query in dataset 2 (by time), preventing multiple matches for the same queries.

Infinite Ratios:

Filter out entries where ms1 = 0 during matching to prevent division by zero
Added filtering in plotting and analysis functions to handle any remaining infinite values
Too Many Matches: The new algorithm ensures each entry can only be matched once, so the total matches will be ≤ the smaller dataset size.

Key Improvements:
One-to-one matching: Each query entry can only be matched once
Best match selection: Chooses the temporally closest match within the time window
Robust plotting: Filters infinite values and caps extreme ratios for better visualization
Better statistics: Excludes infinite values from ratio calculations
Debug output: Shows how many entries are being processed and matched
The script should now run without errors and provide more accurate matching results. The number of matched queries should be much more reasonable (likely in the hundreds rather than thousands), and the performance ratios should be finite numbers that can be properly visualized.
```

From here I fixed up a lot of bad code, and re promted it to make better graphs
